Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Visualization is a Python project developed in Jupyter Notebook that explores and visualizes patterns in road accident data to identify key contributing factors such as road conditions, weather, and time of day. Using real-world datasets (e.g., from government transportation agencies or open data portals), the project performs data cleaning, feature extraction, and exploratory data analysis to uncover trends and correlations. The notebook includes interactive and static visualizations such as heatmaps, time series plots, and geospatial maps to highlight accident hotspots and high-risk conditions. This project is designed for learners and analysts interested in data science, public safety, and urban planning. Open-source and highly customizable, it provides a strong foundation for developing data-driven solutions to improve road safety and decision-making.Traffic Accident Data Analysis and Visualization is a Python project developed in Jupyter Notebook that explores and visualizes patterns in road accident data to identify key contributing factors such as road conditions, weather, and time of day.
